One Word v.00
Daniel Nguyen - @nguyenmints

One word is a simple jQuery plugin that takes a designated block of text
and prints it one word at a time in a modal. Its supposed to help you read
faster. Its meant to work like the iPad app ReadQuick (http://readquickapp.com/).

It requires jQuery. Its using 1.9 but should work with older versions.
